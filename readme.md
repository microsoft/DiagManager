Pssdiag/Sqldiag Manager is a graphic interface that provides customization capabilities to collect data for SQL Server using [sqldiag collector engine](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqldiag-utility). The data collected can be used by [SQL Nexus tool](https://github.com/Microsoft/SqlNexus)  which help you troubleshoot SQL Server performance problems.


## Notice of Retirement
The pssidag Configuration Manager utility is no longer in active development and will not receive future updates or enhancements. This decision was made because its functionality has been superseded by more modern solutions.
We recommend using [SQL LogScout](https://github.com/microsoft/sql_logscout) as the preferred alternative for similar diagnostic and configuration tasks going forward.

## How it works
This tool lets you customize what you want to collect and then let you create a data collection package. You extract the package and run SQLdiag data collector engine on the SQL Server you are troubleshooting.

## Feature Highlights

1. **Powerful data collection capabilities:** The tool relies on SQLdiag collector engine to provide collection of perfmon, profiler trace, msinfo32, errorlogs, Windows event logs, TSQL script output and registry exports.
1. **Default templates/scenarios:** You can choose SQL Server version and platform (32 bit or 64 bit). The tool will automatically choose a default template for the combination. This will have default set of perfmon counters, profiler traces.
1. **Shipped with ready to use Custom collectors:** Most commonly used [custom collectors](https://github.com/Microsoft/DiagManager/wiki/Custom-Collector) include SQL Server 2005, 2008 or 2008 R2 performance collector.
1. **Customization/Extensibility:** You can customize what perfmon and profiler trace events you want to collect. Additionally, you can create your own custom collectors with TSQL Scripts, batch files and utilities.   See [customization guide](https://github.com/microsoft/DiagManager/wiki/Creating-Custom-Collectors).
1. **Packaging:** With a single click of save, the tool will package all your files into a single cab so that you can ship to the machine where you intend to execute it.
1. **Integration with SQL Nexus** :  The custom collectors shipped will collect data that can be analyzed by [SQL Nexus Tool](https://github.com/Microsoft/SqlNexus).
