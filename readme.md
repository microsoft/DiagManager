## What is Pssdiag/Sqldiag Manager?
Pssdiag/Sqldiag Manager is a graphic interface that provides customization capabilities to collect data for SQL Server using sqldiag collector engine. The data collected can be used by [SQL Nexus tool](https://github.com/Microsoft/SqlNexus)  which help you troubleshoot SQL Server performance problems.  This is the same tool Microsoft SQL Server support engineers use to for data collection to troubleshoot customer's performance problems.

## How it works
This tool lets you customize what you want to collect and then let you create a data collection package. You extract the package and run SQLdiag data collector engine on the SQL Server you are troubleshooting.

## Feature Highlights

1. **Powerful data collection capabilities: ** The tool relies on SQLdiag collector engine to provide collection of perfmon, profiler trace, msinfo32, errorlogs, Windows event logs, TSQL script output and registry exports.
2. **Default templates/scenarios** : You can choose SQL Server version and platform (32 bit or 64 bit). The tool will automatically choose a default template for the combination. This will have default set of perfmon counters, profiler traces.
3. **Shipped with ready to use Custom collectors** :  Most commonly used [custom collectors](http://diagmanager.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Custom%20Collector)include SQL Server 2005, 2008 or 2008 R2 performance collector.
4. **Customization/Extensibility: ** You can customize what perfmon and profiler trace events you want to collect.   Additionally, you can create your own custom collectors with TSQL Scripts, batch files and utilities.   See [customization guide](http://diagmanager.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Creating%20Custom%20Collectors).
5. **Packaging:** With a single click of save, the tool will package all your files into a single cab so that you can ship to the machine where you intend to run on.
6. **Integration with SQL Nexus** :  The custom collectors shipped will collect data that can be analyzed by [SQL Nexus Tool](http://sqlnexus.codeplex.com/).
